Build 0011

We upgrade our technology stack to JQuery Mobile 1.0 and phonegap 1.2.0
Unless we find bugs in these libraries, these will be the ones we ship with for our initial release.

Note: There was one change to our css which was required by the upgrade to JQM.
We were adding some custom padding to .ui-btn-inner in the home icon, which resulted in a non-centered icon. I've commented out the offending css:
.ui-header .ui-btn-inner {
	padding: 0.4em 5px 0.5em;
}

.ui-header a.hm-circle .ui-btn-inner {
	padding:0;
}

Otherwise, the state of the build is the same as 0004, as follows:

This build incorporates Zena's feedback on the big-5 "up" button sections, and the move of the Anemia page from "things to avoid" to "things to check".

Still pending:
* About / License pages
* App styling according to the latest Design Powerpoint.

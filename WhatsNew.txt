Build 0003

This is an interim build, which I'm rolling out mostly for internal testing.

1) It has newer art for big 5 buttons and submenus (not yet validated as the very latest).
2) It has a preliminary implementation of the "Up" button. Recall that each page will now have a preferred "Up" big5, as well as some other "allowed" big 5's. 
	When you go to a page, we keep the current "Up" big5 direction if it's allowed, but if it's not, we revert to the preferred one. I've seeded the preferred / allowed big5's with some initial values which are sufficient for testing the behavior of the app, but we've not yet coordinated deciding on what the correct values are. The visual look of the up button is also preliminary.

So, lot's of "preliminary" in this build, but I wanted to see where we were ...

Build 0010

- New build, which (I hope) addresses some of the issues we've run into installing on newer devices.

State of the build is the same as 0004, as follows:

This build incorporates Zena's feedback on the big-5 "up" button sections, and the move of the Anemia page from "things to avoid" to "things to check".

Still pending:
* About / License pages
* App styling according to the latest Design Powerpoint.

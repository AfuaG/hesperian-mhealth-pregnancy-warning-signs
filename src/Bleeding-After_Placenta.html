				<li>Ask the mother to urinate. A full bladder prevents the womb from contracting.</li>
				<li>Keep the mother lying down and put the baby to her breast. If the baby will not suckle, try rolling the mother's nipples. This will make the womb contract and stop bleeding.</li>
				<li>Firmly rub the top of her womb at the level of her navel until the womb becomes hard. Keep rubbing until the bleeding has stopped.</li>
				<li>If the womb does not become hard after a few minutes of rubbing, or if bleeding continues, give medicine to stop the bleeding.</li>

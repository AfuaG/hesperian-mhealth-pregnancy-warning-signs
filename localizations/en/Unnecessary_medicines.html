			<p>Medicines a pregnant woman takes also pass to her baby.  And some medicines that are safe for an adult, can cause birth defects or other harm to the baby.  So pregnant women should avoid most medicines. For minor problems like headaches, stomach aches, and colds, rest and fluids are better treatment than medicines.</p>

			<p>But some illnesses are too harmful to leave untreated throughout pregnancy. Always treat for malaria, bladder or kidney infections, HIV or AIDS, and sexually transmitted infections.</p>

			<p>Ask an experienced health worker if you are not sure if a particular medicine is safe in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.</p>

            <p><span class="hm-content-strong">Method 2:<br>
            Heat the mother's urine to check for&nbsp;protein.</span></p>
            
           <p> Ask the mother to wash her genitals well and then
            urinate into a clean container. Then pour the urine
            into a test tube to within 2&nbsp;centimeters (or one inch)
            of the top of the&nbsp;tube.</p> <p>  <img src="images/chunked_41.png" class=
            "hm-content-imgright" width="145">Heat the upper part of the tube
            over a small burner, low flame, or candle until the
            urine boils. (Keep turning the test tube or the glass
            will break.)</p>

            <p>If the urine is clear, there is no protein in it. If
            the urine becomes cloudy and white, add a few drops of
            vinegar (2% acetic acid). If the cloudiness goes away,
            there is no protein in the urine. If it stays cloudy or
            gets whiter, there is protein in the urine. </p>
            
            <p>If the
            woman has protein in her urine and high blood pressure, she has
            pre-eclampsia. When a woman has severe pre-eclampsia,
            the urine may become very cloudy, white, and thick.</p>
